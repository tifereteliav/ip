Below is a practical, clinic-ready framework for designing a questionnaire / digital decision-support app that helps adults with type 1 diabetes choose between the Medtronic 780G, Tandem t:slim X2/Mobi, and Omnipod 5.
I integrate the comparison information from the uploaded Panther tool 

compare pumps panther tool

 and common clinical considerations used in pump-matching.

1. DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Your questionnaire/app should:

⭐ Be short (5–7 minutes)

Patients lose engagement in long surveys. Use branching logic so they only see relevant questions.

⭐ Use plain language

Avoid algorithm jargon. Provide tooltips or short explanations.

⭐ Match patient needs → device features

Each answer should directly map to characteristics of pumps (e.g., tubeless preference → favors Omnipod 5).

⭐ End with a personalized recommendation

Either:

Top 1–2 pump options with rationale, or

A “pump compatibility profile” summarizing fit across domains.

2. CORE DOMAINS TO INCLUDE

From clinical practice and the Panther comparison tool, these are the domains that matter most:

1️⃣ Lifestyle & Wearability Preferences

Tubed vs tubeless

Comfort wearing a device on body

Ability/willingness to carry a phone

Sports/exercise style

Travel, swimming, work environment

2️⃣ Tech Preferences & Phone Ecosystem

iPhone vs Android

Desire to bolus from phone

Comfort with app-based operation

Need for remote monitoring (caregivers, partners)

3️⃣ Glucose Management Style

Importance of automated boluses

Preference for adjustable targets

Desire to tune settings (I:C, CF, basal profiles)

Use of sleep/activity modes

4️⃣ Current CGM Preference

Dexcom (G6/G7)

Guardian 4

Glooko/Discover/Tidepool/Beta Bionics data ecosystem

5️⃣ Hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia concerns

Fear of lows

Need for aggressive correction algorithms

Need for strong automation during meals/overnight

6️⃣ Insurance / cost / availability

(Optional in app; essential in clinic workflow.)

3. RECOMMENDED QUESTIONNAIRE STRUCTURE

Below is a ready-to-use template you can convert into an app, Google Form, or EMR-integrated form.

SECTION A — DEVICE WEAR & LIFESTYLE

1. Do you prefer a pump with or without tubing?

No tubing (patch pump) → favors Omnipod 5

Tubing is okay → allows t:slim / Mobi / Medtronic 780G

2. How comfortable are you wearing a device directly on the skin?

Very comfortable → any pump

Prefer a separate device in pocket → t:slim / Mobi / 780G

3. Do you prefer dosing insulin directly from your phone?

Yes → strongly favors t:slim/Mobi (iPhone), Omnipod 5

No → any pump

4. What type of activities do you do most often?
(check all)

High-intensity sports

Swimming/water sports

Frequent travel

Sedentary
Logic:

Heavy sports → Omnipod 5 often preferred (no tubing).

Frequent travel → all usable, but Omnipod/t:slim easier for airport security.

SECTION B — CGM PREFERENCES

5. Which CGM do you currently use or prefer?

Dexcom G6/G7 → t:slim X2/Mobi, Omnipod 5, iLet

Guardian 4 → Medtronic 780G only

Libre 2+ or Libre 3+ → t:slim, Omnipod (limited), Twiist
(mapping per chart)

6. Do you want to share CGM/pump data with someone (partner/parent)?

Yes → all except Libre-based systems

Need pump+CGM remote view → 780G, t:slim/Mobi, Omnipod 5

SECTION C — AUTOMATION STYLE

7. How important is it that the pump gives automated correction boluses?

Very important → Medtronic 780G (every 5 min), t:slim (1/hr)

Not important → Omnipod 5 (no auto boluses)

8. Do you prefer to adjust and customize settings (I:C, correction factor, active insulin time)?

Yes → t:slim, Omnipod 5

No, prefer hands-off → Medtronic 780G (limited adjustment)

9. How tight do you want your glucose target(s)?

100–112 mg/dL range → Medtronic 780G, t:slim

Adjustable depending on time of day → t:slim, Omnipod 5

Single fixed target → Omnipod 5

(mapping per Panther chart)

SECTION D — HYPOGLYCEMIA/HYPERGLYCEMIA RISK

10. How concerned are you about low blood sugars?

Very → pumps with strong low-prevention behavior

t:slim (Control-IQ sleep mode)

Omnipod 5 (aggressive suspend)

11. How important is the ability to aggressively correct highs?

Very → Medtronic 780G (frequent auto-corrections)

SECTION E — PHONE & DATA USE

12. What phone do you use?

iPhone → compatible with all except Medtronic mobile bolus limitation in some regions

Android → Omnipod 5 supports fewer Android models; t:slim/Mobi iOS only

13. Do you want to be able to see pump and sensor data together on your phone?

Yes → t:slim/Mobi, Omnipod 5, Medtronic 780G, Twiist

SECTION F — PATIENT PRIORITIES (RANKING)

Ask patient to rank the following from most to least important:

Maximum automation

Least visible on body

No tubing

Strong correction of highs

Best low-glucose prevention

Most customizable settings

Phone-based control

Lowest burden / simplest workflow

The app can weigh responses and generate a profile.

4. HOW TO SCORE OR MATCH RESPONSES
Example weighting model (simple)
Feature	Strongly Favors	Moderate	Not Ideal
Tubeless	Omnipod 5	–	t:slim, Medtronic 780G
Auto-corrections	780G	t:slim	Omnipod 5
iPhone bolus from phone	t:slim/Mobi	Omnipod 5	780G
Dexcom loyalty	t:slim/Mobi, Omnipod 5	–	780G
Want simplest workflow	Omnipod 5	780G	t:slim
Need tight overnight control	t:slim sleep mode	780G	Omnipod 5

Your app can tally these behind the scenes and display, for example:

Your Best Fit: Tandem t:slim X2

Why:

You prefer Dexcom

You want adjustable targets

You want remote bolusing from phone

You value strong overnight protection

You prefer more control over pump settings

5. OPTIONAL: CLINICIAN MODE

Allow clinicians to enter additional data:

A1C

TIR

Hypoglycemia unawareness

Carbohydrate counting accuracy

Occupation (e.g., pump visibility concerns)

The system can adjust recommendations—for example, poor carb counting may favor pumps with more automated correction (780G).

6. FINAL OUTPUT EXAMPLE (AUTO-GENERATED)

Top Recommendation: Omnipod 5
• You prefer a tubeless system
• You want phone-based control
• You engage in regular sports
• You use Dexcom G6/G7
• You prefer simple automation without needing to adjust settings

Secondary Option: t:slim X2
• Good if you want stronger auto-corrections or sleep mode

If you want, I can:

✅ Build a fully written questionnaire verbatim
✅ Convert this into a scorable digital flowchart
✅ Create JSON logic for a web/app developer
✅ Draft patient-friendly explanations for each question

Would you like the complete questionnaire text, the algorithm scoring logic, or a prototype layout for an app?
